# Wii-or-VWii-Homebrew-Installer
CMD script(s) to ready your sd card for homebrewing the wii or vwii.
This requires the downloading of cURL https://curl.haxx.se/windows/ for proper downloading.
The script(s) will run using drive letter C so make sure it exists on your computer. 
Also, this script assumes you are either doing the Wuphax exploit for vwii (https://wiiu.hacks.guide/vwii-modding.html#section-ii---wuphax) or letterbomb (https://wii.guide/letterbomb) for wii.


Please refer to the wiki (https://github.com/Mattamech/Wii-or-VWii-Homebrew-Installer/wiki) for trobleshooting.



Version python-3.0.1
This is a unique version of the project where Python 3.x does most of the work. This patch still requires cURL and also requires wget on python (pip install wget).
Only Wii version is currently finsihed.
